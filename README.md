# Playing Tie Tac Toe using Python
Allows two users to play Tic Tac Toe locally (sitting at the same
laptop). Board is set up as a list, where each index 1-9 corresponds with a
number on a number pad, to achieve a 3 by 3 board representation. Places first
player's marker in the desired index, then the other player. Board is printed
every time a player makes a move. Game continues until the occurrence of a
three-in-a-row or tie, and users are prompted to play again.
